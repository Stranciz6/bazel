Usage: blaze info <options> [key]

Displays information about the state of the blaze process in the
form of several "key: value" pairs.  This includes the locations of
several output directories.  Because some of the
values are affected by the options passed to 'blaze build', the
info command accepts the same set of options.

A single non-option argument may be specified (e.g. "blaze-bin"), in
which case only the value for that key will be printed.

If --show_make_env is specified, the output includes the set of key/value
pairs in the "Make" environment, accessible within BUILD files.

The full list of keys and the meaning of their values is documented in
the Blaze User Manual, and can be programmatically obtained with
'blaze help info-keys'.

See also 'blaze version' for more detailed blaze version
information.
