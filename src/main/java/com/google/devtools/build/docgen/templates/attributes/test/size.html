How "heavy" the test is
<i>(String "enormous", "large" "medium" or "small",
default is "medium")</i><br/>
A classification of the test's "heaviness": how much time/resources
it needs to run.
Unittests are considered "small", integration tests "medium", and
end-to-end tests "large" or "enormous". Bazel uses the size only
to determine a default timeout.
