The list of files needed by this rule at runtime.
<i>(List of <a href="build-ref.html#labels">labels</a>; optional)</i><br/>
Targets named in the <code>data</code> attribute will appear in
the <code>*.runfiles</code> area of this rule, if it has one.  This
may include data files needed by a binary or library, or other
programs needed by it.  See the
<a href="build-ref.html#data">data dependencies</a> section for more
information about how to depend on and use data files.
<p>Almost all rules permit a <code>data</code> attribute, but where
this attribute is not allowed, this fact is documented under the
specific rule.</p>
