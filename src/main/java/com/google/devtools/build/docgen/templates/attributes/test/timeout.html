How long the test is
normally expected to run before returning.
<i>(String "eternal", "long", "moderate", or "short"
with the default derived from a test's size attribute)</i><br/>
While a test's size attribute controls resource estimation, a test's
timeout may be set independently.  If not explicitly specified, the
timeout is based on the test's size (with "small" &rArr; "short",
"medium" &rArr; "moderate", etc...). "short" means 1 minute, "moderate"
5 minutes, and "long" 15 minutes.
