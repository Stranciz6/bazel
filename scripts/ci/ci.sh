# This script looks at the files changed in git against origin/master and
# queries for all build and test targets associated with those files.
#
# Running this script on a CI server should allow you to only test the targets
# that have changed since the last time your merged or fast forwarded.
#
# This script can be used to recreate the benefits that TAP provides to
# Google's developers as describe by Mike Bland on his article on Google's
# infrastructure.
# https://mike-bland.com/2012/10/01/tools.html#tools-tap-sponge
#
# "Every single change submitted to Googleâ€™s Perforce depot is built and
# tested, and only those targets affected by a particular change are
# built and tested"
#
# When your code is running on Gerrit (for example) and you have a fast-forward
# only policy on your repo you can be sure, by diffing from the origin/master..
# refspec, that you're listing all the files that are included in a review.
# This would let a team working on Gerrit have the verified bit be
# autopopulated without having the pain of having to wait for the whole world
# to compile.
