# Supported Skylark Rules

The Bazel team provides a set of supported build rules written using the
[Skylark](/docs/skylark/index.html) rules framework. These rules allow you
to build the following:

*   [Closure libraries](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_rules/closure)
*   [Docker images](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_defs/docker)
*   [Groovy projects](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_defs/groovy)
*   [Java App Engine applications](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_rules/appengine)
*   [Rust projects](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_rules/rust)

The source for these rules are located in the
[tools/build_rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_rules)
and
[tools/build_defs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/tools/build_defs)
directories in the Bazel GitHub repo.
